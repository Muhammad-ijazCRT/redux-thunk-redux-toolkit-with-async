Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://redux.io))

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.

## Installation

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

For the Redux core library by itself:

```
npm install redux
```

For more details, see [the Installation docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).
